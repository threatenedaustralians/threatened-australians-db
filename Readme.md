# Threatened Australians (threatened.org.au) database

**This repository produces the database behind the web app.**

The [Threatened Australians](https://www.threatened.org.au/) project was born out of a recognition that Australian species are in a disastrous state and without better support, they will continue to decline. Australians and their elected representatives can provide that support by talking about it. If we talk about it, we can start to encourage those in power to do what they can to provide the necessary solutions.

## Overview
Start with the R Markdown files found in the `doc` directory. The `*.r` files found in the project directory are the corresponding scripts. `/scripts` is where multiple `.r` and `.py` scripts that scrape and request the required data for `*.r` files come from.

*The `/data` and `/output` directories are sparse as most data is in large files. Feel free to contact me if you're interested in the data. The `.Rmd` files detail where to get all raw data.*
